# Loom — Architecture & Design Decisions

## Goal

A self-modifying coding agent that can rewrite its own code, test modifications in isolated Lab containers, and promote successful changes — all in pure ClojureScript on Node.js.

**Status:** MVP complete. First self-modification cycle (gen-1) succeeded 2026-03-15. Tasks tracked in [beads](https://github.com/lispmeister/beads) (`beads list`). Architecture reviews in [`architecture-reviews/`](architecture-reviews/).

## Architecture

### Roles

- **Prime Container (Gen 0)** — The orchestrator. Reads `program.md`, spawns Labs via the Supervisor, observes results, decides promote or rollback. The user interacts only with Prime.
- **Supervisor** — Host-side infrastructure. Manages container lifecycle (create, start, stop, destroy) and hard timeouts. Does NOT decide on pruning — that's Prime's job. Handles git operations (branching, tagging) as part of the lifecycle.
- **Lab Container** — A full clone of the agent that executes tasks from `program.md` autonomously. Runs the complete agent loop with LLM access. Has full network access. Commits work to its generation branch before executing new code.

### Execution Model

1. User refines `program.md` (task spec + acceptance criteria) in conversation with Prime. Prime generates it, user approves.
2. Prime constructs the complete container environment: full repo clone on a `lab/gen-N` branch with `program.md` included.
3. Supervisor creates the Lab container on the `loom-net` network. Boot auto-starts the research task — no explicit "go" signal.
4. Prime polls `http://lab-gen-N:PORT/status` (with connect-retry for readiness) to monitor progress.
5. Supervisor enforces a hard timeout of 5 minutes per Lab run.
6. When Lab reports done (or times out), Prime independently verifies: pulls the Lab's branch, runs tests, sends eval probes, checks benchmarks — per `program.md` criteria. (Trust but verify: Lab runs its own tests AND Prime checks independently.)
7. **Promote:** Merge `lab/gen-N` into `main`, tag `gen-N`, serialize Prime state, restart Prime with new code.
8. **Rollback:** Discard `lab/gen-N`. On failure, Prime retries with same `program.md` (v0). Auto-refine (Prime analyzes failure and improves `program.md` before retry) planned for post-v0.

### Acceptance Criteria (heterogeneous)

The `program.md` declares which criteria apply for each task:

- **Tests** — for hard requirements (e.g., "these LLM providers must be accessible")
- **Eval probes** — Prime independently verifies Lab behavior (e.g., "this API returns valid JSON")
- **Benchmarks** — for performance/optimization tasks (e.g., "latency must be < 200ms")

### `program.md` Contract

- The sole directive for a Lab run — analogous to Karpathy's autoresearch
- User and Prime collaborate to write and refine it before each Lab spawn
- Contains: task spec, acceptance criteria, success conditions
- `program.md` is the prompt: Lab reads it at boot and works autonomously from there

### Networking

- Supervisor creates a `loom-net` custom network via `container network create loom-net`
- All containers (Prime + Labs) attach to `loom-net` via `--network loom-net`
- DNS resolution built-in: Prime reaches Lab by container name (e.g., `lab-gen-1`)
- No IP discovery or port mapping needed
- Lab readiness: Prime polls `/status` with connect-retry until Lab responds

### Default Ports

| Component | Port | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Supervisor | 8400 | HTTP dashboard, `/spawn`, `/promote`, `/rollback` |
| Prime | 8401 | HTTP dashboard, `/chat`, `/logs`, `/stats` |
| Lab | 8402 | `/status` endpoint, eval server (TCP) |

### Git Strategy

- `main` — always tracks current Prime code (known-good)
- `lab/gen-N` — branch created when Lab N is spawned, Lab commits here
- On promote: merge `lab/gen-N` into `main`, tag `gen-N`, delete lab branch
- On rollback: discard `lab/gen-N`, Prime stays on `main`
- Tags provide unlimited rollback depth

### Lineage Tracking

Supervisor maintains `generations.edn` in its working directory, versioned in git. Per generation:

- Generation number
- Parent generation
- Branch name
- `program.md` hash
- Outcome (promoted / failed / timed out)
- Timestamps (created, completed)
- Container ID

### State Continuity Across Generations

Three problems to solve:

1. **Serialize state** — snapshot the outgoing Prime's state before promotion
2. **Load state** — hydrate the incoming Prime from the snapshot
3. **Schema evolution** — handle format differences between generations

**v0 approach:** State as simple EDN with a version tag. If schema doesn't match, start fresh (git tag preserves the old state for inspection). Proper schema migration logic needed as soon as state format stabilizes.

### Lab HTTP API

- `GET /status` — structured JSON: running/done/failed, test results, progress (v0)
- REPL (eval server from Phase 2) — for deep inspection and debugging (post-v0 priority)

## Known Constraints

- **Labs cannot self-test** — Shadow-cljs compilation takes ~25s inside the container VM, leaving insufficient time within the 5-min timeout. Labs must NOT run `npm test` or any compilation commands. Prime's `verify_generation` tool runs tests host-side after the Lab reports done.
- **Tailscale VPN breaks containers** — Apple Containerization vmnet routing fails with Tailscale active. Disconnect before running Labs, then `container system stop && container system start`.
- **Lab artifacts excluded via .gitignore** — `lab-worker.js` and `program.md` are written to workspace `.gitignore` during `setup-lab-repo` to prevent merge into main.
- **Dynamic host ports** — Lab containers publish `0:8402` (dynamic host port) to avoid collisions on sequential spawns.

## Not in v0

- Streaming from Claude API
- Multi-provider support
- MCP
- TUI
- Sub-agents
- Parallel Lab exploration (tree search)
- Generational chaining (Labs spawning children)
- Autonomous self-modification triggers (user-prompted only)
- Formal verification
- Production deployment
- Live user↔Lab interaction (Labs are autonomous for now)
- Auto-refine `program.md` on failure (retry only for v0)
- Lab REPL for deep inspection (eval server available but not wired to Prime)
